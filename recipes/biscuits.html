    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Every baker needs a good buttermilk biscuit recipe in their repertoire. If you don't have a go-to yet, you're in
        luck! Chef John's take on classic buttermilk biscuits is a favorite in the Allrecipes community. Best of all,
        it's easy to make with ingredients you probably have on hand.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>7 tablespoons unsalted butter, chilled in freezer and cut into thin slices</li>
        <li>¾ cup cold buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons buttermilk for brushing</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone baking mat or parchment
            paper.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in a large bowl. Add cold butter slices and cut
            into the flour with a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
        <li>Make a well in the center of the mixture. Pour cold buttermilk into the well and stir gently until just
            combined.</li>
        <li>Turn dough onto a floured work surface and pat it together into a rectangle.</li>
        <li>Fold the rectangle in thirds. Turn dough a half turn, gather any crumbs, and flatten back into a rectangle.
            Repeat twice more, folding and pressing the dough a total of three times.</li>
        <li>Roll dough on a floured surface to about 1/2 inch thick. Use a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit cutter to cut
            biscuits. Reroll any scraps to cut more biscuits; you should get 12 total.</li>
        <li>Transfer biscuits to the prepared baking sheet. Press an indent into the top of each biscuit with your
            thumb. Brush buttermilk over the tops.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until biscuits are flaky and golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
